# 🔥Text to HTML

A simple yet powerful tool designed to transform plain text into clean and structured HTML.

## 🧰 Why I Built This Tool

As part of my daily work migrating websites and designing pages in a CMS, I often found myself spending too much time manually creating boilerplate HTML. It was repetitive and slowed down my workflow. This tool was built to streamline that process, now I can simply copy and paste content and instantly generate clean, structured HTML, saving time and reducing errors.

It also served as a great opportunity to practice developing in React while solving a real-world problem I encounter regularly.
